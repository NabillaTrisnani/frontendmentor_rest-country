This is my solution to [Frontend Mentor REST Countries API with color theme switcher challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca).

## Overview

The challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

**User should be able to:**

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode (optional)
